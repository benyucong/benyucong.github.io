We present SHARP, a library that employs state reduction to achieve efficient best-effort pattern matching for complex event processing (CEP), OLAP, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). SHARP achieves a recall of 97%, 96% and 73% for pattern matching in CEP, OLAP, and RAG applications, under a bound of 50% of the average processing latency.
